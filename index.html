          Crime is an unavoidable feature of any city. What does it look like in the
          city of Denver, Colorado specifically? To answer this question, let's
          take a look at all of the recorded crime between the years of 2013 and
          2017 within the city limits. We'll begin by breaking out all of the
          crime events by type. We see that the most common event is <i>Public Disorder</i>
          and the least common event is <i>Murder</i> (this is much better than the
          other way around). Hover over each bar to get the exact number of
          recorded events.

        <p>
          Next, let's inspect how the prevalence of crime has varied over the
          recorded time frame. To do this, we'll look at the ratio of the total
          number of crime events to the population of Denver. Visualizing this
          particular metric, we see that crime has actually decreased over the
          time period of the year 2013 to 2017. Hover over each data point to
          get the exact metric.

            <p>
              Let's continue to look at crime over time but with a sharper
              focus. To do this, the occurrence of crime events in the years 2013-2017
              have been aggregated per day. Based
              on this metric, a color has been assigned to each day with darker
              colors representing more crimes occurring on that day. Some interesting
              things to note: It appears that crime could be increasing during the
              summer months. This trend is not apparent for the remainder of the years,
              leading one to suspect that perhaps the certain crimes were not recorded
              at the start of the year considering that this is the first year they
              were recorded in this manner. Another interesting feature is that we
              can clearly distinguish Christmas Day by it's markedly lighter color.
              Criminals apparently have more important things to do on the holiday.

          </div>
          <div class = "text-calendar">
            <p>
              Again, we can see that significantly less crime occurs on Christmas day.

              In 2015, we see similar trends for the Christmas and Thanksgiving.
              Also note that there was significantly less crime recorded on February
              22nd, 2015. I was unable to find a suitable explanation. I would love
              to <a href="https://nickreinicke.space/contact/">hear</a> from any
              reader that has a theory as to why this anomaly might appear.

              Note here that it appears the weekends experience marginally less
              crime rates than the weekdays.

          <div class = "text-calendar">

              Finally, in 2017, we observe similar trends with respect to the previous
              years. We see that the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays are tied
              to a significantly lower crime rate. In addition, we see bands of lower
              crime rates on the the weekends. What other trends are visible?

          To wrap up our investigation let's dive into some of the dirty details.
          We'll take a deeper look at the instances of murder that occurred in
          Denver between 2013 and 2017. You can go forward or backward in time
          using the slide below the map and you can zoom in for
          more detail. Note that there are certain areas that can be distinguished by
          a clear clusters of murders.

        <h6>Narrative Structure</h6>
        <p class="about_text">
          The hybrid narrative structure chosen for this visualization is the interactive
          slideshow structure. The users are presented with a series of scenes that they
          can investigate in various ways. A visual template with a fixed color scheme is
          used to maintain consistency.
        </p>
        <h6>Scenes</h6>
        <p class="about_text">
          This visualization has been organized into discrete scenes and allows
          the viewer to scroll through all of the scenes from top to bottom
          (the viewer can also click on the navigation bar to go directly to
          a scene). Each scene presents a new dimension of the data and gives
          the viewer details on demand in certain instances. The order was chosen
          to give the user an overview and then dive down into interesting characteristics.
        </p>
        <h6>Annotations</h6>
        <p class="about_text">
          Annotations are used throughout the visualization to draw attention to
          specific interesting elements. Each slide contains text that highlights
          various aspects of the data that is being displayed. In addition,
          certain slides have direct annotations to emphasize especially interesting
          features of the data that are being displayed (the annotations are cleared
          when the users moves from year to year). Finally, there are tooltips on
          nearly all the visualizations that give the user more detail. These are presented
          upon a mouseover event and removed upon a mouseout event.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-right">
        <h6>Parameters</h6>
        <p class="about_text">
          The use of parameters are most effectively demonstrated on the
          <a href="#murder_map">murder map</a> scene. Here, the parameter of
          <i>year</i> is used to filter each murder event that is being displayed
          on the map. In addition, we could consider the scale of the map elements
          to be a parameters that varies as the viewer zooms and pans the map.
        </p>
        <h6>Triggers</h6>
        <p class="about_text">
          Again, the use of triggers are best demonstrated on the
          <a href="#murder_map">murder map</a> scene. Below the map is a slider
          that allows the user to change the horizontal position of the handle.
          By doing so, this event triggers the map to redraw the murder events
          that are equal or less than the year indicated by the slider. In addition,
          the user can scroll and click on the map which triggers the map to be
          redrawn according to the appropriate scale.
        </p>
        <h6>Data</h6>
        <p class="about_text">
          The data for this project was sourced from the
          <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime">Denver Open Data Catalog</a>
          and was cleaned and manipulated with python.
